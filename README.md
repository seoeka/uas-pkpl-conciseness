# Conciseness
<p>In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a feature based on Software Quality Factors, which is one of the critical factors in software testing. I chose one of McCall's Factor Models to create this feature, namely, the Conciseness factor, which is a part of Efficiency. According to McCall, Conciseness refers to the compactness of a program (this program only accept input in C# language) in terms of the number of Line of Commands (LOC). The calculation method :
<p><q>Conciseness = total features (method or function or procedure) / LOC</q></p>
