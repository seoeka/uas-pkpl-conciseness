# Conciseness
<p>In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a feature based on Software Quality Factors, which is one of the critical factors in software testing. I chose one of McCall's Factor Models to create this feature, namely, the Conciseness factor, which is a part of Efficiency. According to McCall, Conciseness refers to the compactness of a program in terms of the number of Line of Commands (LOC). The calculation method, as per the journal <a href="https://digilib.uin-suka.ac.id/id/eprint/24473/1/Agus%20Mulyanto%20-%20PENGUJIAN%20SISTEM%20INFORMASI%20AKADEMIK%20MENGGUNAKAN%20MCCALL%E2%80%99S%20SOFTWARE%20QUALITY%20FRAMEWORK.pdf">Pengujian Sistem Informasi Akademik Menggunakan McCall's Software Quality Framework</a>, is as follows:</p>

<p>Conciseness = (total classes / LOC) * 100%"</p>
