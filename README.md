# Conciseness
<p>Creating a feature based on Software Quality Factors, which is one of the critical factors in software testing. I chose one of McCall's Factor Models to create this feature, namely, the Conciseness factor. According to McCall, Conciseness refers to the compactness of a program (this program only accept input in C# language) in terms of the number of Line of Commands (LOC). In these app here are the calculation method :
<p><q>Conciseness = LoC / total features (method or function or procedure)</q></p>
<p><q>Conciseness = Executable LoC / total features (method or function or procedure)</q></p>
